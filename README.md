# Lamp
_A discord bot to query Wolfram|Alpha_

Lamp is a small bot made to allow you to `,ask` wolfram alpha questions from discord chats.  It intelligently handles whether to output images or text, and returns results in a colorful series of embeds.

Lamp makes use of Rapptz' very nice [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library.

It's built to run on Linux but probably works other operating systems too.
